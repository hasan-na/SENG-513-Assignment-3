- The final product is around the same as I expected

- Some challenges I faced were properly trying to implement click listeners for the cells and properly displaying the color for the displayed player and their pieces

- Another challenge was the win condition I chose to use a brute force method instead of designing an algorithm simply because it was easier to do so but it took a decent amount of time

- Another problem i faced was whenever i started the game an entierely new board would be created instead fo overwriting the existing one. 

- This assignment taught me how to properly handle resetting a game state without creating a new board and how to properly implement click listeners for the cells.

- It also taught me how to properly keep tracks of players scores and display them along with the players status's.
