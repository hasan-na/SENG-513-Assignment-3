The first complex part of my code is creating the board thats required to play. I first create a 2D matrix in my javaScript file that is identical to the UI, once i create this i instantiate the UI board by getting the cells from my HTML and adding a click listener for each cell in the board. This sequence creates a 2D array for my technical portion and for the user to play on. 

The second complex portion of the game was the win condition. This part was not very difficuly since I used brute force solutions for each individual way to win in connect4. The user can win horizontally, vertically and diagonally which invloves many different scenarios for a player to win. I check from the position of the newly put piece and check if the player has won in each of these ways. 

The third complex portion of the game is checking the players moves. I first check if the game has started or not, after that I check for the win conditions to make sure that no one can still make moves after a player has won. After that I take the column of the player that put their piece and check each row to see where te piece should be placed, i then check for win coditions again to see if the player has won. If they won the game stops and displays that the player won or a draw occured. If no one has won it then switches to the other players for them to do their turn.
